This is a website based on the Hamster Hotel prototype. It is intended to be very accurate to the prototype, while also being responsive to different screen sizes.

Richards nav bar is really good.  I like how the logo disappeered too to make room for the options!  The first pool image is good too, really like how it pops out when you drop the window smaller.   The only thing with the full screen is some some margins on a few areas but most of the items on the page looked good.  Great job Richard
